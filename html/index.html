                    "Thomas Edison conducted one thousand failed experiments. 
                    Did you know that? I didn't know that,
                    because the one thousand and first was the lightbulb." - Denzel Washington

                My name is Jesus Correa and I am
                a Computer Science major at San Francisco State University. 
                I am an incoming Computer Science Lab Student Instructor.<br><br> This position means
                so much to me as a person who really struggled with coding. After one summer of intense studying,
                I am at a stage where I am very confident with my Java skills.
